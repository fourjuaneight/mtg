# MTG

![worker](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/mtg/actions/workflows/worker.yml/badge.svg)<br/>

I keep a [Magic The Gathering database](https://cleverlaziness.com/mtg/) of all the cards I own. This worker is how I add, update, and query that data.

All code is self-documented. Aside from the specific names of bases and tables in Airtable, everything is easily portable and ready to fork. You'll just need to provide your environment variables.
